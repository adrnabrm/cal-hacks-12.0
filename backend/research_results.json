      "summary": "The provided source, \"Research Paper Structure\" from the UC San Diego Department of Psychology website, primarily outlines the website's navigation and general departmental information. It does not contain any specific content or guidance on the \"Introduction\" section of a research paper.\n\nTherefore, I cannot expand on the \"Introduction\" section based on the information given in this source. To provide an educational summary of a research paper's introduction, I would need a source that details its purpose, components, and significance.",

      "summary": "Introductions in research papers serve as a crucial \"reference framework\" for the reader, setting the stage for the entire study. Their primary functions are to:\n\n1.  **Establish Scope and Boundaries:** Clearly define what the research project will cover and what it will not.\n2.  **Highlight Relevance:** Communicate the importance and significance of the problem or topic being discussed.\n\nAccording to John W. Creswell, a well-structured introduction typically includes five key components:\n\n1.  **Establishing the Problem:** Clearly identify and present the central issue or question that the study addresses.\n2.  **Reviewing the Literature:** Briefly discuss existing research and scholarly work related to the problem, providing context.\n3.  **Identifying Deficiencies in the Literature:** Point out gaps, limitations, or unanswered questions in the current body of research that your study aims to address.\n4.  **Targeting an Audience and Noting Significance:** Explain who will benefit from this research and why the problem is important to this specific audience or field.\n5.  **Stating the Purpose/Research Questions (implied by \"e\"):** Though cut off, the fifth component typically involves explicitly stating the study's purpose, research questions, or hypotheses.\n\nIn essence, an introduction guides the reader from a general understanding of the topic to the specific focus and contribution of the research paper.",
